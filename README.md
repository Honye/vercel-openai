# Vercel OpenAI

Proxy the OpenAI API with Vercel's Edge Functions

Inspired by [cloudflare-proxy](https://github.com/barretlee/cloudflare-proxy)

## Why Proxy

- No need to use VPN all the time
- No need worry about API Key being stolen

## Deploy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhonye%2Fvercel-openai)

Use `https://<your domain>/api` as proxy address

必须自定义域名才能在国内正常访问

*I Love Vercel!*

```bash
# Node.js v18+
